# About

My goal with this is to focus in low-scale and low-tier battles in large maps, with a total unit count in a battle no higher than 20 (aprox) per team and with the best tier that could be 
more or less mass produced being T3, and maybe at some point a T4 boss fight

The main change is the physics and mechanics of units like altitude, landing, drag, acceleration / momentum, fuel, and item / fuel weight to name some, units now need to stay up in the air to not crash and fuel for their engines to work, more weight means less thrust from the engine,
weight comes from fuel, items and the unit itself, if the engine works, the unit goes up, and if not, the unit starts losing altitude.
