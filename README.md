# Mindustry-Frontiers
![logo](Assets/Resources/Sprites/UI/logo.png)

A Mindustry related game i'm working on, very similar to mindustry but with the objective of making battles and whole matches (multiplayer is supported) more cinematic looking

Most of the sprites are copy-pasted from mindustry for now, excluding the turrets and some other units


Why?:

My goal with this is to focus in low-scale and low-tier battles in large maps, with a total unit count in a battle no higher than 20 (aprox) per team and with the best tier that could be 
more or less mass produced being T3, and maybe at some point a T4 boss fight

To this, i added "real" physics to units like altitude, landing, drag, acceleration / momentum, fuel, and item / fuel weight to name some, units now need to stay up in the air to not crash and fuel for their engines to work, more weight means less thrust from the engine, 
, weight comes from fuel, items and the unit itself, if the engine works, the unit goes up, and if not, the unit starts losing altitude.
