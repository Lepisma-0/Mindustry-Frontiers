Upgrade system example


Base content: Flare

  stats:
cost = 15 silicon
health = 75
drag = 0.1
fuelConsumption = 1.25
fuelMass = 3.5
emptyMass = 10



Applied upgrades:


  - Fuel efficiency

  stats:
requiredUpgrades = enginePower & refinedFuel
upgradeResearchCost = (Completely arbitrary) 100 silicon
upgradeCost = (Also completely arbitrary) 7 silicon

fuelConsumption = 1.25 => 1.00
fuelMass = 3.5 => 3.00



  - Heavy armor

  stats:
requiredUpgrades = advancedAlloys
upgradeResearchCost = 220 silicon
upgradeCost = 8 titanium

health = 75 => 110
drag = 0.1 => 0.15
emptyMass = 10 => 13.5



Final stats:

health = 110
drag = 0.15
fuelConsumption = 1
fuelMass = 3
emptyMass = 13.5
